used the google colab starter code to complete this assignment due to issues I was having with pyspark and java "security" features. big thank-you to Emmanuel who recommended in a tutoring session 3/2025 to use the colab code instead of the jupyter notebook code--somehow the cloud environment was much better than all our attempts to fix my anaconda/jupyter/visualstudio issues. after Emmanuel helped me fix the pyspark issue, I coded within the google colab environment successfully.
